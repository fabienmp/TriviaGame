# Trivia Game

This browser game is themed around scientific facts about black holes. 

## Getting Started

1. Simply Click on the start button.
2. Questions will appear and disapear automatically. 
3. At the end of the quiz, the player has the choice to restart it again. 

## Extras

The code was designed to be flexible. The questions for the quiz can quickly be changed using the 'questions' global array. The quiz can be made easier/harder by manipulating the global variable 'TIME_ALLOWED_QUESTION' (Set to 5 seconds by default).
